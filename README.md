# NRICValidator
A terminal and library that helps you validate Singapore NRIC numbers

Inspired by the lecturer taking me for Java Programming, I decided to read and check out the computation specifications for Singapore's NRIC numbers.

This repository is a little practice for my beginning in Java Programming; though I have already learnt multiple languages.

## Compilation

### Requirements

```
Java SE Development Kit 8
```

### Run project

```
$ javac main/main.java
$ java main/NRICValidator <NRIC NUMBER>
```

## Personal Data Protection Act

The project NRICValidator created by Aaron Teo does not create any incoming or outgoing connection to the Internet. Therefore, the NRIC numbers you provide will not be stored anywhere.

### For Linux Systems

If you would like to completely clear your usage, please run the following command:

```
history -c
```

And verify that your NRIC numbers are cleared by running:

```
history
```
