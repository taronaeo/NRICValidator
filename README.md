# NRICValidator
A terminal and library that helps you validate Singapore NRIC numbers

Inspired by the lecturer taking me for Java Programming, I decided to read and check out the computation specifications for Singapore's NRIC numbers.

This repository is a little practice for my beginning in Java Programming; though I have already learnt multiple languages.
